                <p class="Lead">Hello, I am Dylan Gorman, I am 40 years old, married, father of 2 living in South Liverpool. I Have just recently completed <a href ="https://wearecodenation.com">The Code Nation </a>
                   Develop - Coding course and I have applied to enter the Masters Course. I am looking to start a new career path after being made redundant from my previous occupation as an Audio/Visual Rental Operations Manager. After a year of searching for a new Career path and talking to lots of different people. The word coding kept coming up. So I invested in a new laptop and started looking at tutorials on line and before I knew it I was completely engrossed and smitten by coding and software/web development! It was one of those light switch moments, that after all these years from being an Assistant Baker to Credit Control assistant to Musician, Band manager and Sound Engineer and finally an Operations Manager, I thought "Why haven't I been learning code all this time?!".</p>

              <p class="Lead">A long time ago I studied Art at A-Level and Completed a BTec course in Art & Design. I was offered several places at University for Graphic design. I decided not to pursue this path, however my eye for detail and my creative flair never left me, and now with developing I can use this creativeness in coding. The Code Nation Develop Coding Course has been a brilliant introduction to coding and I wanted to learn more about the basics and to learn new skills. The team at Code Nation have been exceptional and nurtured me and my skills and talents. Although I had been approached by my old company to rejoin them as an Operations Manager, I wanted to complete the Develop Coding Course to learn something new and to see if I could change career at a later stage in life. The course has reaffirmed that I have made the correct decision to continue on this path. I feel this is where I belong now.

            <p class="Lead">The Develop Course has introduced me to Python, HTML and CSS along with using systems like Kanban and connectivity programmes such at Slack, Zoom, codeshare and GitHub. The Develop Coding Course started with learning Python, this was a brand new area for me, however after the first week the fundamentals had definitely sunk in. During the second week of the course, we were put into teams to create a Text Based Adventure game in Python. I was appointed Team Leader and I really enjoyed that role. I transferred my leading skills from being a Warehouse and Operations Manager into this project with great confidence, leading the team to deliver a fantastic Zombie Themed game which was received greatly by our peers and tutor. I also took the role of lead creative and this allowed me to write up an original plot to the game. I thoroughly enjoyed being creative as well as leading the team. I also helped a lot with the more complex coding. Debugging a lot during testing. I really enjoy spending hours looking at code and being creative to make things work. I love a good challenge and my years of being a skilled Sound Engineer, helped with lots of problem solving. </p>

            <p class="Lead">The last week of the course we learnt HTML and CSS. As I had previously watched many tutorials on these two languages and also how to implement Bootstrap and some JS, it gave me a great advantage and also gave me more time and space to be creative when we had to create our first Website. I based my website around my Wife's illustrations and absolutely loved this part of the course. I spent hours upon hours on CSS, trying and testing ways to make the website come alive. Mainly using Transitions, Transforms and Media Queries. CSS really lets my creativity flow and it has been one of my favourite areas to learn so far.</p>

          <p class="Lead">To start with I have enjoyed learning Python and its many functions. From creating lists to making a small cash machine function, ending with a huge Adventure game, I felt it was a brilliant language full of endless possibilities. I also really like Leading a small Team of people to accomplish something of merit, getting everyone involved really brings me joy and to set out individual tasks to team members. Watching my team all get stuck in was amazing and by the time we came to present our game, it was hard to stop talking about it as we had so much enthusiasm for what we created! Lastly, I do have a huge passion for creativity and using HTML and CSS can really help me express myself, as I really love the design element of developing, I can use my artistic skill as well. I want to keep learning and develop my developing! If I am accepted onto the Masters course, I will take on every new challenge with great aplomb and build my coding repertoire along with expanding my Team Leader skills. I think I would be a great asset to any company willing to hire me as I have enthusiasm, creativeness and leadership skills along with being very professional and having an exceptional attendance and participation record. I am also very willing to learn new languages in coding. I thrive on a good challenge! In the meantime, I am going to research more on Python, html, CSS and JS, so I am ready for any challenge that may come!
